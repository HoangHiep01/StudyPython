Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Python interpreter)

+ Take advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate(chia) memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Greate for CPU-bound(rằng buộc) processing
+ New process is started independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
